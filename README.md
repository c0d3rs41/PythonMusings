# PythonMusings
This repo contains some of the fun python projects I have created.<br><br>
Contents include:
* A web scraper, which by default scrapes the personal website of the famous "Dr. Chuck" and stores the links in a database. The program uses <b>sqlite</b>.<br>
<b>WARNING</b>: Use web scrapers with caution. Read the bot regulations of a website before using any web scraper.
* A game developed using pygame module called "Space Invader". It is just a basic game and does not have a start menu.
